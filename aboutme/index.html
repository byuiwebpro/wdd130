    <h2>Elijah Guanabo</h2>
    <p>My name is Elijah Guanabo and I am from a country called Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG is within the Pacific Region and is just North of Australia.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of the Church for 15 years now and completed my mission in 2010. I am married and have 4 beautiful God-given children ages 8 - 2 years old.</p> 
    <p>The thing I love about BYU-Idaho is that they have made it possible for us to at least learn some valuable skills and earn certificates.</p> 
    <p>My major is Applied Technology and the reason why I chose this is that this will be an essential skill today and into the future.</p>
    <p>I hope to learn as much as possible from these courses and from you all.</p>
